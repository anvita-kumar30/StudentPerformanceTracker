This is a website which helps the students to track their own performance. This website also allows the students to create their own schedules for the day.

There is an About Us page which tells the users about our website in a small slideshow.

The next button is the source for Study Materials. Here the student can find youtube links/pdfs all at one single place. These links will not only help them in studies but also they have links for improving soft skills.

Student Performace Tracker is a very helpful website for the students as it would help them have all the sources together at one single place!
